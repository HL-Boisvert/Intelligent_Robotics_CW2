This paper describes our implementation and analysis of obstacle avoidance and line following behaviours for an
e-puck robot. The goal was to get a better understanding and use
of robot simulators and software tools to support the creation of
intelligent controllers for robots using the bio-inspired methods
covered in the course. Starting from specific environment configurations, we applied the bio-inspired algorithms to create the
intelligent controllers for the e-puck robot and then we analysed
the resultant robot behaviours and finally we draw conclusions
from our results.
